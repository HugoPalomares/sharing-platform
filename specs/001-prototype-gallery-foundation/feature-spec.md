# Feature Specification: Prototype Gallery with Authentication Foundation

**Author:** Hugo Palomares  
**Date:** September 17, 2025  
**Feature Branch:** 001-prototype-gallery-foundation  
**Status:** Planning

**Implementation Approach:** React app with Fluent UI components, mock authentication system, and three-section gallery layout
**Context:** Foundation feature that establishes core user experience and technical architecture for the entire prototype distribution platform

---

## Executive Summary

A secure web application that allows Microsoft creators to discover, browse, and access shared prototypes through a centralized gallery interface. This feature establishes the foundation for secure prototype sharing by providing a professional, Microsoft-branded platform where creators can find and access prototypes without resorting to insecure external tools or static screenshots.

---

## Problem Statement

Microsoft creators (designers, PMs, non-technical employees) are successfully building functional prototypes using AI-powered tools, but they have no secure, professional way to share them internally:

- **Current pain points**: Prototypes scattered across Teams links, emails, and screenshots; no centralized discovery; security anxiety with external tools
- **User impact**: Creators either risk security violations with external tools, burden engineers with deployment requests, or resort to static screenshots that miss interactive experiences
- **Business impact**: Innovation stalls due to slow feedback cycles; impressive prototypes remain on laptops; knowledge sharing breaks down
- **Why existing solutions fall short**: Internal deployment requires DevOps expertise creators don't have; external tools violate Microsoft security policies; screenshots don't capture interactive nature of prototypes

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Discovery and Browsing

**US-001**: As a Microsoft creator, I want to browse all available prototypes with search and filtering so that I can discover relevant work and find inspiration for my own projects
* **Happy Path**:
  - Land on gallery homepage showing three sections: Favorites, My Prototypes, All
  - Use search bar to find prototypes by title, author, or tags
  - Apply filters by product area, author, or recency
  - View prototype cards with metadata (title, author, description, tags, last updated)
  - Click on prototype card to access detailed view or launch prototype
* **Design**: Clean grid layout with prominent search, clear visual hierarchy, Microsoft design language
* **Edge Cases**: Empty search results, slow loading, no prototypes available
* **Test**: Verify search returns relevant results, filters work correctly, empty states display properly

### Personal Collection Management

**US-002**: As a Microsoft creator, I want to manage my personal prototype collection in "My Prototypes" so that I can track my work and control access
* **Happy Path**:
  - Navigate to "My Prototypes" section
  - See all prototypes I've created with status indicators
  - View prototype details and access controls
  - See who has access to each prototype
* **Edge Cases**: New user with no prototypes, prototype with no description
* **Test**: Verify only user's prototypes appear, access controls display correctly

### Favorites and Quick Access

**US-003**: As a Microsoft creator, I want to maintain a favorites list so that I can quickly access prototypes I reference frequently
* **Happy Path**:
  - Heart/favorite a prototype from any view
  - See favorited prototypes in "Favorites" section
  - Remove items from favorites
  - Quick launch favorited prototypes
* **Edge Cases**: No favorites yet, favorites from deleted prototypes
* **Test**: Verify favorites persist across sessions, removal works correctly

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

* **FR-001**: System MUST display prototypes in three distinct sections (Favorites, My Prototypes, All)
* **FR-002**: System MUST provide search functionality across prototype titles, authors, and tags
* **FR-003**: System MUST include filtering by product area, author, and recency
* **FR-004**: System MUST provide simple mock authentication (login button â†’ user state) to simulate authenticated experience
* **FR-005**: System MUST display prototype metadata (title, author, description, tags, last updated)
* **FR-006**: System SHOULD support favorites functionality for quick access
* **FR-007**: System SHOULD handle empty states, loading states, and error conditions gracefully

### Design Requirements

* **Consistency**: Follow Microsoft Fluent UI design system and established patterns
* **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design that works seamlessly on desktop (640px+) and mobile (<768px)
* **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus indicators, screen reader support
* **Performance**: Fast loading with skeleton states, smooth interactions, optimized for perceived performance

## Success Criteria

### Functional Validation

* [ ] All three gallery sections display correctly with appropriate content
* [ ] Search and filtering return relevant results quickly
* [ ] Simple mock authentication provides logged-in user state for testing
* [ ] Prototype cards display all required metadata clearly
* [ ] Favorites functionality works across all sections

### User Experience

* [ ] Interface feels familiar to Microsoft users (consistent with Office/Teams/Azure)
* [ ] Navigation is intuitive without documentation or training
* [ ] Responsive design works smoothly across all device sizes
* [ ] Loading and empty states provide clear feedback to users
* [ ] Interactions feel polished with appropriate microinteractions

---

## Scope & Constraints

### In Scope

* [ ] React application with Fluent UI v9 components
* [ ] Three-section gallery layout (Favorites, My Prototypes, All)
* [ ] Search and filtering functionality
* [ ] Simple mock authentication (basic login state management)
* [ ] Prototype card display with metadata
* [ ] Responsive design for desktop and mobile
* [ ] Empty states, loading states, error handling
* [ ] Favorites functionality

### Out of Scope

* [ ] Real Entra ID integration (Feature 2)
* [ ] Actual prototype storage and upload (Feature 4)
* [ ] Real-time collaboration features
* [ ] Advanced analytics or reporting
* [ ] Mobile app (web responsive only)
* [ ] Prototype version management

### Technical Constraints

* [ ] Must use Fluent UI v9 components exclusively
* [ ] No external dependencies beyond React ecosystem
* [ ] Follow constitution principles (simplicity, anti-abstraction)
* [ ] Mobile-first responsive implementation
* [ ] Mock data must be realistic and compelling for demo purposes

## Sets Foundation For

- **Future Feature**: Real Entra ID authentication integration (Feature 2)
- **Technical Capability**: Component architecture that supports Azure service integration
- **User Journey**: Established UX patterns for prototype discovery and access that scale to hundreds of prototypes
