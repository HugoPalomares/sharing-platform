# Feature Specification: GitHub Prototype Publishing

**Author:** Hugo Palomares  
**Date:** September 18, 2025  
**Feature Branch:** 003-github-prototype-publishing  
**Status:** Planning

**Implementation Approach:** GitHub OAuth integration with webhook-triggered automated deployment pipeline to centralized App Service architecture
**Context:** Transform platform from mock data showcase to real prototype publishing system, enabling creators to easily connect repositories and automatically deploy live prototypes

---

## Executive Summary

Implement a GitHub repository integration system that allows creators to connect their prototype repositories and automatically deploy them as live, hosted prototypes within the platform. This feature transforms the prototype gallery from displaying mock data to hosting real, live prototypes that creators can easily publish, update, and share with their teams.

---

## Problem Statement

The prototype gallery currently displays mock data, severely limiting its value for real-world prototype sharing and collaboration:

- **Publishing Friction**: Creators have no way to share their actual prototypes through the platform
- **Collaboration Barriers**: Teams cannot easily discover and access each other's real work
- **Update Complexity**: No automatic sync between prototype development and platform display
- **Value Proposition Gap**: Platform cannot fulfill its core mission without real prototype hosting
- **Manual Overhead**: Any current sharing requires manual file uploads, builds, or external hosting
- **Business Impact**: Platform remains a demo rather than a production tool for Microsoft creators

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Creator Prototype Publishing

**US-001**: As a Microsoft creator, I want to connect my GitHub prototype repository so that my team can access my live prototype through the platform
* **Happy Path**:
  - Navigate to "Add Prototype" in platform
  - Paste GitHub repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/user/my-prototype)
  - Platform authenticates with GitHub using OAuth
  - Platform automatically detects React app and builds/deploys it
  - Live prototype appears in gallery with generated URL
  - Team members can immediately access and interact with prototype
* **Design**: Clean, simple form with GitHub URL input and one-click connection
* **Edge Cases**: Private repos, build failures, invalid URLs, non-prototype repositories
* **Test**: Verify end-to-end flow from URL paste to live prototype access

### Automatic Updates and Collaboration

**US-002**: As a Microsoft creator, I want my prototype to automatically update when I push changes to GitHub so that my team always sees the latest version
* **Happy Path**:
  - Creator pushes changes to connected GitHub repository
  - GitHub webhook triggers platform build pipeline
  - Platform rebuilds and redeploys prototype automatically
  - Updated prototype is immediately available to team members
  - No manual intervention required from creator
* **Edge Cases**: Build failures, webhook delivery issues, simultaneous updates
* **Test**: Push changes to repo and verify automatic redeployment within 5 minutes

### Team Discovery and Access

**US-003**: As a Microsoft creator, I want to discover prototypes published by my team members so that I can learn from their work and provide feedback
* **Happy Path**:
  - Browse "All Prototypes" section in gallery
  - See real prototypes published by team members
  - Click to open live prototype in new tab/iframe
  - Interact with fully functional prototype
  - See prototype metadata (author, last updated, repository link)
* **Edge Cases**: Private repository permissions, broken prototypes, metadata extraction failures
* **Test**: Verify gallery displays real prototypes with correct metadata and functional links

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

* **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate with GitHub using OAuth to access public and private repositories
* **FR-002**: System MUST automatically detect React applications and static HTML/CSS/JS projects
* **FR-003**: System MUST build and deploy prototypes to centralized hosting architecture
* **FR-004**: System MUST implement webhook-based auto-deployment when repositories are updated
* **FR-005**: System MUST extract and display prototype metadata (title, description, author, last updated)
* **FR-006**: System MUST generate unique URLs for each deployed prototype
* **FR-007**: System MUST handle build failures gracefully with error reporting

### Performance Requirements

* **Build Time**: Complete build and deployment cycle under 5 minutes for typical React app
* **Availability**: 99.5% uptime for deployed prototypes during business hours
* **Concurrent Builds**: Support up to 5 simultaneous prototype builds
* **Storage Efficiency**: Optimize prototype storage to minimize Azure costs

### Security Requirements

* **OAuth Security**: Secure GitHub token storage and management
* **Repository Access**: Respect GitHub repository permissions and privacy settings
* **Prototype Isolation**: Ensure prototype hosting security and isolation
* **Data Protection**: Secure handling of repository metadata and build artifacts

## Scope & Constraints

### In Scope

* [ ] GitHub OAuth integration for repository access
* [ ] Automated build pipeline for React and static HTML/CSS/JS projects
* [ ] Webhook-based automatic redeployment
* [ ] Basic prototype metadata extraction and display
* [ ] Centralized hosting architecture with unique prototype URLs
* [ ] Error handling and build status reporting
* [ ] Integration with existing gallery UI

### Out of Scope

* [ ] Advanced build configurations or custom build scripts
* [ ] Comment system or collaborative features (Phase 5)
* [ ] Access control and permission management (Phase 6)
* [ ] Dynamic configuration system or knobs (Phase 7)
* [ ] Integration with other version control systems besides GitHub
* [ ] Custom domain configuration for individual prototypes

### Technical Constraints

* [ ] Must use centralized App Service + Database architecture for future extensibility
* [ ] Must support both public and private GitHub repositories
* [ ] Must be compatible with future Microsoft EMU GitHub integration
* [ ] Must maintain existing gallery functionality while adding real prototype hosting
* [ ] Must handle build processes within Azure infrastructure limitations

### Azure Resources Required

## Sets Foundation For

- **Phase 5**: Collaborative features with location-based commenting system on live prototypes
- **Phase 6**: Advanced access control and sharing with per-prototype permissions
- **Phase 7**: Dynamic configuration system with runtime knob management
- **Microsoft EMU Integration**: Enterprise-ready GitHub integration for private organizational repositories
- **Real User Validation**: Actual prototype usage data and feedback collection

---

## Assumptions and Validation

### Core Assumptions

* **GitHub-First Workflow**: Microsoft creators prefer GitHub integration over manual file uploads for prototype publishing
* **Automatic Deployment Value**: Creators value automatic updates over manual deployment control for prototype sharing
* **Centralized Hosting Preference**: Teams prefer accessing prototypes through unified platform rather than individual hosting solutions

### Validation Approach

* **User Testing**: Validate GitHub connection flow with target creators before full implementation
* **Technical Validation**: Prototype build pipeline with representative React applications and static sites
* **Performance Testing**: Ensure deployment speed meets creator expectations for iteration workflows
* **Integration Testing**: Verify webhook reliability and automatic update functionality
