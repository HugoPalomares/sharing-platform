# Feature Specification: Azure Deployment Pipeline

**Author:** Hugo Palomares  
**Date:** September 17, 2025  
**Feature Branch:** 002-azure-deployment-pipeline  
**Status:** Planning

**Implementation Approach:** Azure App Service deployment with GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline and production environment configuration
**Context:** Enable creators to access and share prototypes via live, secure Azure-hosted platform instead of local development servers

---

## Executive Summary

Deploy the prototype gallery React application to Azure App Service with automated CI/CD pipeline from GitHub, enabling Microsoft creators to access the platform via a public URL without requiring local development setup. This transforms the prototype gallery from a development-only tool into a production-ready platform that creators can use to discover and share prototypes securely within Microsoft's infrastructure.

---

## Problem Statement

The prototype gallery currently only runs locally, creating significant barriers for the target users:

- **Access Barrier**: Creators need technical knowledge to run `npm install` and `npm run dev` locally
- **Sharing Limitation**: No way to share the gallery itself - only individual prototypes can be shared
- **Collaboration Friction**: Team members can't access the same gallery instance to discover shared prototypes
- **Demo Challenges**: Cannot demonstrate the platform to stakeholders without local setup
- **Discovery Problem**: Each creator has their own isolated local instance, defeating the purpose of centralized discovery
- **Business Impact**: Platform cannot fulfill its core value proposition of centralized prototype sharing until it's accessible online

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Creator Platform Access

**US-001**: As a Microsoft creator, I want to access the prototype gallery via a web URL so that I can discover and share prototypes without local development setup
* **Happy Path**:
  - Navigate to Azure-hosted URL (e.g., prototype-gallery.azurewebsites.net)
  - See professional Microsoft login screen
  - Sign in with mock authentication
  - Browse prototypes in familiar three-section layout
  - Search, filter, and favorite prototypes as before
* **Design**: Identical UX to local version, but accessible via public URL
* **Edge Cases**: URL not responding, slow loading, broken functionality after deployment
* **Test**: Verify all Phase 1 functionality works in production environment

### Team Collaboration and Discovery

**US-002**: As a Microsoft creator, I want my team members to access the same prototype gallery instance so that we can collaborate on prototype discovery and sharing
* **Happy Path**:
  - Share Azure URL with team members
  - Team members access same gallery with same prototype collection
  - See prototypes added by other team members in "All Prototypes"
  - Maintain individual favorites lists
  - Consistent experience across team
* **Edge Cases**: Simultaneous access by multiple users, data consistency
* **Test**: Multiple users accessing gallery simultaneously, verifying shared data consistency

### Stakeholder Demonstrations

**US-003**: As a Microsoft creator, I want to demonstrate the prototype gallery to stakeholders via a live URL so that I can showcase its value without requiring local setup
* **Happy Path**:
  - Send Azure URL to stakeholders in advance of meeting
  - Demo the platform live during presentations
  - Stakeholders can interact with gallery during demo
  - Show realistic prototype discovery scenarios
  - Demonstrate search, filtering, and favorites functionality
* **Edge Cases**: URL down during demo, slow performance, authentication issues
* **Test**: Platform performs well under demo conditions, professional appearance

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

* **FR-001**: System MUST deploy React application to Azure App Service successfully
* **FR-002**: System MUST maintain all Phase 1 functionality (authentication, search, filtering, favorites)
* **FR-003**: System MUST handle React Router SPA routing correctly on Azure
* **FR-004**: System MUST implement automated deployment via GitHub Actions on code changes
* **FR-005**: System MUST serve application over HTTPS with SSL certificate
* **FR-006**: System MUST handle production environment variables and configuration
* **FR-007**: System SHOULD provide application monitoring and error logging

### Performance Requirements

* **Load Time**: Initial page load under 3 seconds on standard internet connection
* **Availability**: 99.5% uptime during business hours (allowing for Azure maintenance)
