# Design Intent Infrastructure for Spec-Driven Development
Author: Hugo Palomares

## Introduction

The future of software development is emerging at Microsoft: AI-assisted workflows where design intent becomes the primary interface for implementation. A new breed of creators—designers, PMs, and non-technical employees—are building functional prototypes using AI-powered tools, but they lack systematic ways to capture, share, and scale their design decisions as executable specifications.

This platform establishes the foundational infrastructure for design intent capture and spec-driven development workflows. By enabling teams to systematically share prototypes as executable design specifications, we prepare Microsoft for an AI-driven future where design intent becomes the source of truth for automated implementation.

The immediate problem: creators can build impressive prototypes with AI assistance, but have no way to share them as living design specifications within Microsoft's secure infrastructure. This creates scattered design knowledge, inconsistent implementation, and missed opportunities to build organizational design dialects that will become critical for AI-assisted development.

We need design intent infrastructure that transforms prototypes from isolated experiments into shared organizational knowledge, establishing the foundation for systematic design consistency and AI-ready development workflows.

## Design Intent Challenges

Through conversations with early adopters of AI-assisted development at Microsoft, we've identified critical gaps in design intent capture and sharing:

> "I build prototypes that capture my design thinking, but there's no way to share the 'why' behind my decisions with the team."

> "Every prototype dies in isolation. We rebuild the same interactions because we can't discover what others have already solved."

> "AI helps me code, but it doesn't understand our Microsoft design dialect. I keep having to re-explain our specific patterns."

> "I have great design intent documentation workflows locally, but no way to share them as living specifications with my team."

### Design Knowledge Fragmentation

- **Isolated Design Decisions**: Each creator develops solutions independently without organizational knowledge sharing
- **Lost Design Reasoning**: The 'why' behind design choices disappears when prototypes are shared as static links
- **Inconsistent Implementation**: Teams cannot systematically apply organizational design dialects at scale
- **AI Training Gap**: No systematic capture of design intent for future AI-assisted development
- **Discovery Chaos**: Valuable design patterns remain hidden in individual repositories
- **Context Loss**: Design specifications lack the executable context needed for accurate implementation

This creates systemic challenges:
- Design knowledge doesn't compound across teams
- AI assistance remains generic instead of organization-specific
- Teams are unprepared for spec-driven development workflows
- Design consistency cannot scale beyond individual contributor knowledge

## Technical Challenges

Current internal deployment options at Microsoft require understanding:

- Azure portal navigation and resource creation
- EntraID app registrations and authentication flows
- DNS configuration and custom domains
- CI/CD pipelines and GitHub Actions
- Security compliance and network policies

For someone who just learned to code last week with Copilot's help, this is overwhelming. The result? Prototypes stay on laptops, feedback cycles slow down, and innovation stalls.

## Vision: Design Intent Infrastructure

### Core Mission
Transform prototypes from isolated experiments into systematic design intent capture, establishing Microsoft's foundation for AI-assisted spec-driven development workflows.

### Strategic Objectives

#### 1. Design Intent Capture System
Central platform where prototypes become executable design specifications with embedded reasoning, design decisions, and organizational dialect patterns. Enable systematic capture of "why" alongside "what" for future AI training and team knowledge sharing.

#### 2. Organizational Design Dialect Development  
Build repository of Microsoft-specific design patterns, interaction behaviors, and implementation approaches that go beyond universal design systems. Establish design intent as organizational knowledge asset.

#### 3. AI-Ready Development Foundation
Create structured design specification format that enables AI to understand, implement, and maintain consistency with Microsoft's unique design approach. Prepare infrastructure for spec-driven development workflows.

#### 4. Collaborative Design Knowledge Sharing
Enable discovery and building upon existing design solutions through executable specifications. Transform individual design insights into organizational design intelligence.

#### 5. Systematic Design Consistency
Three-section layout: Favorites, My Prototypes, All. Smart search and filtering prevent overwhelming users when browsing hundreds of prototypes. "New" badges highlight recent work.

#### 6. Flexible Viewing Options
Prototypes can be viewed in gallery with overlay controls (device preview, settings) or directly for full browser capabilities. Wrapper view provides context without constraining functionality.

#### 7. Starter Templates
Pre-built templates with Fluent design components to help creators start with professional-looking prototypes that feel like real Microsoft products.

#### 8. Dynamic Prototype Configuration
Creators can define "knobs" (settings/parameters) that allow prototypes to simulate different scenarios without using real sensitive customer data. Teams can create and save configuration scenarios for different customer meetings, enabling the same prototype to demonstrate various use cases by adjusting parameters like subscription types, user roles, data volumes, or feature flags. This eliminates the need for sensitive data while maintaining realistic demo experiences.

## Suggested Development Roadmap

Using hybrid approach (local development with incremental Azure integration) and spec-driven development workflow:

### Phase 1: Core Gallery Foundation
**Feature 1**: Prototype gallery with mock authentication (local development)
- React app with Fluent UI components
- Gallery layout with search, filtering, favorites
- Mock user authentication and prototype data
- Professional Microsoft design language

### Phase 2: Real Authentication
**Feature 2**: Entra ID authentication integration
- Connect to real Microsoft authentication
- Test security flows while developing locally
- Validate core value proposition with real auth

### Phase 3: Cloud Deployment
**Feature 3**: Azure deployment pipeline
- Deploy React app to Azure App Service
- Set up CI/CD from GitHub
- Configure custom domain and SSL

### Phase 4: Prototype Publishing
**Feature 4**: GitHub repository integration and automated prototype hosting
- GitHub OAuth integration for repo access (public/private repos)
- Automated build pipeline from GitHub webhooks
- Centralized hosting architecture (App Service + Database foundation)
- Basic prototype metadata extraction and management
- Core user flow: Connect repo → automatic deployment → live prototype URL

### Phase 5: Collaborative Features
**Feature 5**: Comments and feedback system
- Location-based commenting system (similar to Figma)
- Page-specific comments with coordinate tracking
- Real-time collaboration and feedback workflows
- Comment management and notification system

### Phase 6: Access Control & Sharing
**Feature 6**: Advanced permission and sharing system
- Per-prototype access control (internal/external guests)
- Configuration-specific access permissions
- Email-based prototype sharing with temporary access
- Enterprise integration (Microsoft EMU GitHub compatibility)
- Audit trails and permission management UI

### Phase 7: Dynamic Configuration System
**Feature 7**: Prototype knobs and scenario management
- Knob definition system (settings/parameters for prototypes)
- Platform-based configuration UI (separate from prototype code)
- Runtime configuration passing to prototypes via platform APIs
- Scenario creation, sharing, and version control
- Launch prototype with specific configurations

Each feature follows `/feature` → `/plan` → `/implement` → `/diary` workflow to maintain context across development sessions.

## Architectural Decisions

### Centralized Backend Architecture
- **Single Azure App Service + Azure SQL Database** for all prototypes and platform features
- **Prototype hosting pattern**: `/prototype/{id}/` subdirectory routing with iframe isolation
- **Shared API layer** for metadata, comments, permissions, and configuration management
- **WebSocket support** for real-time collaborative features

### GitHub Integration Strategy
- **GitHub OAuth** for repository access (supports public/private repos)
- **Webhook-based deployment** triggers automatic builds on repo updates
- **Enterprise compatibility** designed for future Microsoft EMU GitHub integration
- **Automated build detection** for React applications and static HTML/CSS/JS

### Security & Access Model
- **Prototype isolation** via iframe hosting for security
- **Permission inheritance** from GitHub repo access as baseline
- **Platform-specific overrides** for sharing with external guests
- **EMU boundary respect** for enterprise deployment scenarios

### Future Enhancements

- Feedback integration (Forms, comments, analytics)
- Native mobile prototype support (iOS/Android)
- Advanced analytics and usage reporting
- Prototype versioning and rollback capabilities
- Integration with Microsoft Teams for notifications
