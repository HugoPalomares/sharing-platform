# Development Session - September 18, 2025

## Session Goals
Complete Phase 4 of the prototype sharing platform: GitHub repository integration for automatic prototype publishing.

## What We Built
- **Complete GitHub OAuth Integration**: Full authentication flow using GitHub App with popup-based OAuth
- **Repository Validation System**: Backend API to validate GitHub repository access and metadata
- **Prototype Creation Workflow**: End-to-end flow from GitHub authentication to prototype database storage
- **GitHub App Configuration**: Set up "sharing-platform-publisher" GitHub App with proper credentials and permissions
- **Cross-Origin Communication Solution**: localStorage-based popup-to-parent window communication system

## Key Implementation Details

### GitHub App OAuth Flow
- **Decision**: Used GitHub App instead of traditional OAuth for better enterprise compatibility
- **Approach**: Popup-based authentication with backend token exchange
- **Trade-offs**: More complex setup but provides better security and user experience

### Popup Communication Architecture
- **Decision**: localStorage-based communication after discovering `window.opener` was null due to browser security
- **Approach**: Popup stores auth success in localStorage, main window polls for completion
- **Trade-offs**: Slightly less elegant than postMessage but works reliably across all browsers

### Backend Integration
- **Decision**: Express.js backend with Prisma ORM for prototype metadata storage
- **Approach**: RESTful API with GitHub App authentication endpoints
- **Trade-offs**: Simple architecture focused on prototype needs rather than enterprise scalability

### Critical Fixes Applied
1. **CORS Configuration**: Fixed port mismatch between frontend (5174) and backend (3001)
   ```typescript
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5174  // Was incorrectly set to 5173
   ```

2. **GitHub App Credentials**: Resolved missing client secret and callback URL configuration
   ```typescript
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=6e4e9f8d414792f06931c96f2375ddefd8c1c129
   // Added callback URL: http://localhost:3001/api/github/auth/callback
   ```

3. **Popup Detection Logic**: Implemented reliable popup detection using URL parameters
   ```typescript
   const isPopup = urlParams.get('popup') === 'true';  // Backend adds popup=true parameter
   ```

4. **localStorage Communication**: Solved window.opener null issue
   ```typescript
   // Popup stores token
   localStorage.setItem('github_auth_success', JSON.stringify({accessToken, timestamp}));
   
   // Main window retrieves after popup closes
   const authSuccess = localStorage.getItem('github_auth_success');
   ```

## Current State
- ✅ **GitHub Authentication**: Working end-to-end with real GitHub App
- ✅ **Repository Validation**: Can validate and access GitHub repositories using access tokens
- ✅ **Prototype Creation**: Successfully creates prototypes with "pending" status in database
- ✅ **User Interface**: Clean integration with existing prototype gallery UI
- ❌ **Build Process**: Not implemented - prototypes remain in "pending" status
- ❌ **Deployment Pipeline**: No automatic build/serve functionality yet

## Tomorrow's Priorities
1. **Implement Build Pipeline**: Create system to clone, build, and serve GitHub repositories
2. **Add Build Status Updates**: Real-time updates from pending → building → deployed/failed
3. **Repository Cloning**: Implement secure git clone functionality using access tokens
4. **Artifact Storage**: Set up directory structure for built prototype files

## Known Issues
- Debug logging still active in production code (should be removed/controlled by environment)
- No error handling for build failures (will be needed for build pipeline)
- GitHub App permissions may need adjustment for private repositories
- No webhook integration for automatic rebuilds on repository updates

## Handoff Notes
The GitHub integration is fully functional for authentication and repository validation. The next major feature is the build pipeline:

**Key Context for Build Implementation:**
- Access tokens are stored in sessionStorage after successful OAuth
- Repository metadata is stored in database with GitHub owner/repo information
- Backend has `/api/github/repos/{owner}/{repo}` endpoint for repository validation
- Build artifacts should be stored in `./build-artifacts` directory (configured in .env)

**Architecture Decisions Made:**
- GitHub App approach (not traditional OAuth) for better permissions model
- localStorage for popup communication (reliable across browsers)
- Express.js backend with Prisma ORM (simple but sufficient for prototype needs)
- SQLite database for development (can migrate to PostgreSQL for production)

**Established Patterns:**
- Environment variables for all GitHub App credentials in backend/.env
- SessionStorage for client-side token storage
- RESTful API design with proper error handling
- Popup-based OAuth flow with automatic window management

## Design Intent Progress
No custom design patterns were established in this session - focused on integration functionality rather than UI components. The existing Fluent UI components were sufficient for the GitHub authentication workflow.

**Component Reuse:**
- Used existing `AddPrototypeDialog` for GitHub integration
- Added `GitHubAuthButton` component following established button patterns
- Maintained consistency with existing loading states and error handling
